# Build In Public Dashboard

This is a dashboard for the Build In Public community on X.

### Why?

Build in public is a great way to discover motivation, ideas, products, users and mistakes.
However, there is too much noise on X such that it becomes impossible to follow the journey of a product. 

This dashboard tracks updates from users made in the community, combines all tweets into one tweet per day (to reduce noise) and presents them in random order (for equal visibility)

## How does it work?

The dashboard frontend accepts two data sources: a list of users profiles and a list of content i.e. all tweets in the community organized and combined into one tweet per day.

This way for each day the dashboard can be viewed.
