# Build In Public Dashboard

This is a dashboard for the Build In Public community on X.

### Why?

Build in public is a great way to discover motivation, ideas, products, users and mistakes.
However, there is too much noise on X such that it becomes impossible to follow the journey of a product. 

This dashboard tracks updates from users made in the community, combines all tweets into one tweet per day (to reduce noise) and presents them in random order (for equal visibility)

## How does it work?

The dashboard frontend accepts data sources and displays the tweets. 

The first data source will be a file containing user account information.
Second file will contain a list of tweets made by users in a given day. 

## Future plans

 - [ ] AI filtering of irrelvant content
 - [ ] Track a users building journey across weeks and months
 - [ ] Adding product demos at various checkpoints
 - [ ] Intelligent search for relevant content
